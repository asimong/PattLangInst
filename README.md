# Pattern Language Institute

Christopher Alexander's invention  of 'Pattern Language' was an important advance that has only been weakly understood for what it really offers - which is a tool of unparalleled usefulness in mapping complex domains non-reductively, in such a way that they are easy to engage with by humans, with their particular cognitive capacities.

Through developing increasingly complex social and mechanical environments, humans have arrived at a condition where our technical capacity and practical impact have enormous implications for the biosphere of which we are a part. It is crucially necessary that we manage these interactions effectively, wisely - and that we begin to do this rapidly, since we are almost certainly in a condition of severe overshoot in terms of our demands upon the biosphere.

However, our minds are not well equipped to deal with complexity in consciousness - and at the same time, our concept-framed systems are only poorly addressable by our evolved unconsciousnesses.

Human conscious cognitive capacity is highly limited in the number of independent variables which can be considered in parallel - literature suggests that three is about the limit for most people in general circumstances. Complex systems typically arise from the interaction of many factors, which depend upon each other only indirectly, through feedback loops that are often themselves complex and subject to yet other feedback. This renders them effectively impervious to conscious cognition.

Humans typically employ three different modes in such contexts:

1. **Intuitive mode - no attempt at rational / logical / concept-driven decision making.** Reliance instead upon 'feeling'. This is often, in natural systems (especially ones where the decision maker has had  extensive experience) a good choice, since the unconscious/embodied aspect of mind is significantly more capble of integrating multiple signals on the basis of experience. However, in the current human context, where >50% of us live in cities - where we interact most of the time with systems wyhaich are not mediated by exchanges with which we have co-evolved, but through conceptually driven language and increasingly more abstracted mechanical and digitally encoded concepts - our intuitive capcities are significantly less capable, since the embodied brain doesn't 'natively' use conceptual, mechanistic or binary modes.
1. **Heuristic mode** - reliance upon 'tried and tested' approximations. These are risky. While the approach can work within specific bounds, those bounds are hard to recognise, and are rarely encoded into the heuristic, which is itself usually couched as folk wisdom of some kind. Attempts to 'hard code' heuristics only expose their deficiencies.
1. **Reductive formalisation** - in cybernetics, this is also known as Variety reduction (see [Requisite Variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(cybernetics)))
